    "## Path and Trajectory Generation using cubic spirals\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation of the path is done based on cubic spirals. Cubic spirals are third grade polynomial equations that describe the curvature along a path. Our path has a position, a heading and a curvature. The curvature it self has constraints that must be satisfied to count as a valid path, in our case this is the minimal turning radius of the vehicle. In case of lane following, having the same curvature as the road is considered optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offset Goals\n",
    "When following a lane we follow a spiral, the next goal for the path lies in the center of the lane with the curvature similar to the road. But this is only valid if there are no obstacles and no chances of collisions with other cars or road blocks. To be able to calculate an alternative spiral if there is chance of collision, we need offset goals that can alternatevly be achieved if our main goal is not possible. The offset goals must be perpendicular to the main goal heading and are lying within a constant distance along a line left and right to the main goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations and variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Xoffset** and **Yoffset**: These represent the x and y coordinates of each offset goal.\n",
    "- **Xcenter** and **Ycenter**: These represent the x and y coordinates of the center goal.\n",
    "- **goal_number**: This variable represents the index of the offset goal. It can take values from -n to n, where n is the maximum number of offset goals you want to generate. For example, if n is 2, the goal_number will be -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "- **Offset_distance**: This is the distance between the center goal and each offset goal. It determines how far each goal will be positioned from the center goal.\n",
    "- **ùúÉ**: This represents the yaw angle of the curavture.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most effictive ways of collision checking is using circle detection. The vehicle will be enclosed in a set of circles in a way that the whole vehicle shape is covered when viewed from a top down perspective. Three circles are optimal for a regular compact car.\n",

    "For collision to not occur, the distance between center circle of the vehicle and obstacles/actor center circle should be smaller than the sum of radii of these two circles.\n",

    "### Spiral Cost Function \n",
    "\n",
    "Spiral cost function  aims to assign a score to each path, with poor paths that are in collision or too close to static obstacles receiving high cost, while  low cost are assigned to paths that are closer to the center-line of the global path.\n",
    "\n",

    "If there is no collision then the cost due to collision is zero but if there is any collision then the cost due to collision of the curve is infinity. \n",

Looping through spiral points and comparing cumulative distance of those points with accelerate distance with we get all the points of the spiral curve that falls under this distance. We will loop through these points and calulate the speed based on the speed of the last point starting from start speed as initial speed. If the desired speed is higher than the last point speed then we accelerate until it reaches the desired speed. Similary, if the  speed is lower than the desired speed then we decelerate until it reaches desired speed. If the ego vehicle reaches desired speed the speed will remain constant (the desired speed) for all other suceeding points. \n",

    "We then check if the sum of brake distance and decelerate distance exceeds the length of the path or not, if it exceeds then we cannot perform a smooth deceleration and it requires a harder deceleration. So, we build the velocity profile accordingly using deceleration for the spiral curve in reverse to ensure we reach zero speed in the final point or index at the required time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sum of brake distance brake distance and decelerate distance does not exceed the length of the path then smooth decelration is feasible. We find out the the index at which we need to start braking down to zero which is termed as brake index. We then go iteratively through the spiralpoints index and check in which index,the distance is bigger than the brake distance.The brake index will be the first index where the above condition is met.\n",

    "From brake index to stop index, we again start decelerating and hence reducing velocity for each consecutive point till it reaches zero.\n",
